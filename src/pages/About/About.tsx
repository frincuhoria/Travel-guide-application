      We believe that travel is for everyone. It helps us learn about
      ourselves and the world around us.
    </p>
    <p className="text-about">
      Our goal is to help more people from more backgrounds experience the
      joy of exploration. Because we believe this builds a kinder, more
      inclusive, more open-minded world.

    <p className="text-about">
      Like you, travel is in our DNA. At Travel, we believe travel
      opens the door to the greatest, most unforgettable experiences life
      can offer. And we have learned that the best travel is about putting
      yourself out there, about leaving behind the everyday, about immersing
      yourself, rather than just seeing the sights.

    <p className="text-about">
      As travelers, you're on a journey, and at Travel, we're on one,
      too. Over the last two years, travel has transformed. We're thinking
      deeply not just about how we travel but why we travel and how to best
      serve travelers on their journey â€“ and we approach our 50th year with
      a passion and commitment to helping others do it, too.
